# Flight Price Prediction – MLP Assignment 1

This repository contains my complete solution for **Assignment 1** of the **Machine Learning Practices (MLP)** course. The task was conducted as a Kaggle competition, where the objective is to predict flight ticket prices based on provided historical data.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we were given a training dataset and a test dataset. The **labels for the test set were hidden**, and we had to **submit predicted prices** for the test data on Kaggle. The assignment is evaluated via a leaderboard based on model performance.

- **Deadline**: July 2, 2025  
- **Platform**: Kaggle Notebooks

## Models Trained

A minimum of 7 different models were implemented:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Regression  
- XGBoost  

**Hyperparameter tuning** was performed on 3+ models using `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score
